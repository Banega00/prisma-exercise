Prisma is a modern Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool for Node.js and TypeScript. It offers a type-safe and intuitive way to interact with databases, allowing developers to write database queries in their language of choice. Prisma also supports multiple databases and provides features like data modeling, schema migrations, and realtime data synchronization.
